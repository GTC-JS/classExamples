Examples I do in class for JavaScript Sixth Edition Vodnik and Gosselin 

I am an adjunct instructor at Gwinnett Technical College.
We are using 6th Edition of Vodnik and Gosselin's JavaScript book for our CIST-1520 class.

These are the example files I show in class.
You can modify and suggest better examples sending me a pull request.
