//JS is flexible.
//don't need to define a class, the structure of your data
//you can directly create objects
//like class instances in other languages.
var person = {
  "fname" : "Ozgur",
  "lname" : "Ozturk",
  "phone" : "(123) 123-1234"
}

//change later
person.phone = "(888) 888-8888"

//even can add a new field 
person.address = 
    "123 Broadway St, Atlanta, GA 30001";
//or
person["address"]
